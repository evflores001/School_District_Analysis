# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to find trends in both school and student performance based on specified parameters. Using Python and the pandas library within jupyter notebook, two different CSV files containing both student and school information were merged. Both these datasets were merged using the pandas merge function, allowing the information of a student and their respective school to live within the same dataset. Using this initial dataset paved way into finding datasets containing the total school count, total students, total school budget, average math and reading score, as well as the percentage of students passing math, reading, and both; similarly, the dataset containing the breakdown of the aforementioned values for school was found in the school summary dataframe. Some other key datasets that were derived were the top and bottom five performing schools, the average reading and math scores per grade for each school, and student scores based on school spending per student, by school size, and by school type. 

For the purposes of this analysis, some of the values in the student_complete.csv file were modified. The reading and math scores for all 9th grade students attending Thomas High School were assigned NaN values using NumPy. This resulted in changes to the several forenamed datasets. 

## Results 


### How was each dataframe affected by the changes of data:
### How is the district summary affected?
### How is the school summary affected?
### How does replacing the ninth graders' math and reading scores affect Thomas High School's performance relative to the other schools?
### How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
### Math and reading scores by grade
### Scores by school spending
### Scores by school size
### Scores by school type

## Summary
### Summarize four major changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have beenm replaced with NaNs
